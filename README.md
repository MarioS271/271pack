# <p>271pack</p><p>A small, neat resource pack for minecraft. Made using [Vanillatweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net).</p>

<br>

## UPDATE HISTORY:
#### v9.0 (MC 1.21): Remade GitHub Repository and made installer
#### v9.1 (MC 1.21): Fixed text rendering issue, where the text of the inventory and other GUI screens would render black, making it very hard to read
