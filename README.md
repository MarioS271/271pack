# 271pack
A small, neat resource pack for minecraft. Made using Vanillatweaks.

<br>

## UPDATE HISTORY:
- v9.0 (MC 1.21): Remade GitHub Repository and made installer
- v9.1 (MC 1.21): Fixed text rendering issue, where the text of the inventory and other GUI screens would render black, making it very hard to read
- v9.2 (MC 1.21.x): Added for support of latest version
